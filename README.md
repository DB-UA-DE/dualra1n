# dualboot-ios-15-with-14-script
this is a script to dualboot your iphone on ios 15 with 14

1: download your ipsw and put it on ipsw/ directory (you can download of ipsw.me. please only ios 14.* also please download exactly your ipsw for your iphone)

2: execute ./dualboot --dualboot 14.3 (or your ios version that you want to dualboot with also is recommended ios 14.3 because you can jailbreak with taurine) 

3: when the script finished, you will have to record a video of iphone's screen because you have to note the name of the preboot directory when that is booting. 

test it on iphone 6s on ios 15.7 using macos big sur





in the case that you dont trust about binary, you can download of palera1n binary both are the same binary and compile https://github.com/Ralph0045/dtree_patcher.git and copy to binary Darwin directory this is the only binary that palera1n does not have it  



THANKS PALERA1N, https://dualbootfun.github.io/, @MatthewPierson, @Ralph0045 and all people who created the boot patcher tool. thanks
